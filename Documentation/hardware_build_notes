build notes :

Light strip has male connector
Board has female connector

Cut the trace on the power switch if you're using a power switch to the Battery
The strips I bought have a resistor on the first LED. For some reason that won't play nicely with our hardware, so you'll need to cut that first LED off SparkFun_LIS3DH_Arduino_Library
